# Text-to-Text Extraction and Verbalization of Biomedical Event Graphs

This repository provides the source code & data of our paper: [Text-to-Text Extraction and Verbalization of Biomedical Event Graphs]().

In bioinformatics, events represent complex interactions mentioned in the scientific literature, involving a set of entities (e.g., proteins, genes, diseases, drugs), each contributing with a specific semantic role (e.g., theme, cause, site). For instance, biomedical events include molecular reactions, organism-level outcomes, and adverse drug reactions.
Text-to-event (or event extraction, EE) and event-to-text (or event graph verbalization, EGV) systems effectively bridge natural language and symbolic representations. They provide a step towards decoupling concept units (what to say) from language competencies (how to say it).
Almost all contributions in the event realm orbit around semantic parsing, usually employing discriminative architectures and cumbersome multi-step pipelines limited to a small number of target interaction types. Despite being less explored, EGV holds a lot of potential as well, targeting the generation of informative text constrained on semantic graphs, crucial in applications like conversational agents and summarization systems. 
We present the first lightweight framework to solve both event extraction and event verbalization with a unified text-to-text approach, allowing us to fuse all the resources so far designed for different tasks.
To this end, we present a new event graph linearization technique and release highly comprehensive event-text paired datasets (BioT2E and BioE2T), covering more than 150 event types from multiple biology subareas (English language). By streamlining parsing and generation to translations, we propose baseline transformer model results according to multiple biomedical text mining benchmarks and natural language generation metrics. Our extractive models achieve greater state-of-the-art performance than single-task competitors and show promising capabilities for the controlled generation of coherent natural language utterances from structured data.

## Datasets

### Original EE datasets
Our BioE2T and BioT2E datasets are derived from 10 influential benchmarks originally designed for biomedical EE (BEE) and primarily released within BioNLP-ST competitions. For your convenience, we include these freely accessible benchmarks directly within the repository: `data/datasets/original_datasets.tar.gz`.

## BioT2E and BioE2T
We publicly release our BioT2E (`data/datasets/biot2e`) and BioE2T (`data/datasets/bioe2t`) text-to-text datasets for event extraction and event graph verbalization, respectively. For replicability, we also provide the preprocessing, filtering, and sampling scripts used for their automatic generation mostly from EE datasets following a _.txt/.a1/.a2_ or _XML_ structure.
